theorem putnam_1986_b6:
  fixes n :: nat 
    and A B C D :: "'a::field^'b^'b"
  assumes npos : "n > 0"
    and matdim : "CARD('b) = n"
    and hsymm1 : "A ** transpose B = transpose (A ** transpose B)"
    and hsymm2 : "C ** transpose D = transpose (C ** transpose D)"
    and hid : "A ** transpose D - B ** transpose C = 1"
  shows "transpose A ** D - transpose C ** B = 1"
